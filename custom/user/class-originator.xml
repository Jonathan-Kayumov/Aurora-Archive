		<description>
			<p>An elf watches the goblin troop from afar. Aiming for the patrolling eagle high up in the air, she shrouds her dagger in electrical energy before throwing it with immense precision. The moment the dagger touches the eagle, it cries out as the electricity fries it, and it plummets toward the ground.</p>
			<p class="indent">Seeing the destruction of the forest, a halfling places his hands on the charred ground, pouring natural power into it. Green light spreads outward from his palms, and the halfling smiles as the forest begins to regain its color.</p>
			<p class="indent">A tiefling blocks the incoming arrows with a wall of stone, before thrusting the wall forward. It hits the soldiers before breaking apart and pelting them with small shards of stone. The tiefling sends one last volley of rocks at the militia before climbing to the top of a nearby building with a stone pillar.</p>
			<p class="indent">These characters have traits that define them as originators, one of the oldest classes, existent almost since the beginning of time. Mingling fighting ability with energy from the creation of the universe, originators fight with spirit in every concievable way. Although some mistake them for using elemental magic, original magic has far more versatility, and is far more powerful.</p>
			<h4>MAGIC FIGHTERS</h4>
			<p>Although similar to swordmages, originators don't use arcane magic like wizards and sorcerers, but they don't use natural or divine magic like druids and clerics either. Instead, they employ the use of original magic, a form of energy as old as the universe itself; residue from the first instances of the cosmos. For many originators, this magic was either passed down genetically or was purely innate for one reason or another, but a person who has been exposed to raw original energy may begin to gain its power as well.</p>
			<h4>SIX ENERGIES</h4>
			<p>Six types of this original magic exist, and each has its own name and use. Ember, which resembles fire magic; Rime, an icy energy akin to winter magic; Cairn, a similar power to that of the earth; Storm, the combination of air and lightning; Verdure, a natural sort of magic resembling druid magic; and Null, a unique, almost shadowy magic. Originators use one type of original energy only, as more would almost certainly be fatal - mortals are incapable of wielding such power, lest it burst from their body.</p>
			<p class="indent">The different users of original magic have no qualms with each other, and in fact work together quite often. It isn't uncommon to find a group of originators traveling together, each one using a different energy.</p>
			<h4>CREATING AN ORIGINATOR</h4>
			<p>When creating an originator, you should adress both where the power came from, and how you learned to use it. Was it hereditary, and a family member taught you to use it? Or did you one day somehow find cosmic energy, infusing you with the power? And if so, how did you learn how to control it? Or did you never learn how to? You should also ask why you've decided to become an adventurer. Did your unusual powers give you questions, perhaps ones that you have to search for yourself? Or maybe you were simply looking for a way to train yourself. All of these factors impact how you play your originator.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make an originator quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Charisma your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As an originator, you gain the following class features.</p>

The chilling air swept across the regions, and the first Rime originators were infused with this cold energy. With this new energy, they could freeze oceans, bring rain and hail from the skies, and use ice to create great crytalline structures. Rime energy boosts intelligence as well, as the cold stimulates brain activity.</p>

Any ranged spell or weapon attack made against a creature inside the sphere is reflected back at the attacker. If an attack that deals lightning damage impacts the barrier, it is not reflected, and the sphere expands by 5 feet. If a creature touches the barrier, it must make a DC {{ionized-ozone:dc}} Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. A creature attempting to pass through has disadvantage on the save. The sphere dissapates after {{ionized-ozone:duration}}, or when the sphere grows larger than a {{ionized-ozone:max-radius}}-foot radius.</description>

			<p>While similar to druidic magic, Verdure energy manifests in a very different way. Rather than stemming from nature itself, Verdure energy is more so connected to the ecosystem in general, from the plants to the animals and everything in between. With this power, originators can both bring life to nature and take it away. Verdure energy works with the body and the soul, heightening one's wisdom.</p>

			<ul>
                <li>You have resistance to necrotic damage.</li>
                <li>You have advantage on death saving throws, and against effects that could instantly kill you while at full health.</li>
				<li>When you cast the <i>chromatic orb</i> spell, you can spend 1 origin point to attempt to drain the target instead of dealing damage. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC or begin to be drained. While a target is being drained, it has disadvantage on all physical-based ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. On your turn while the creature is being drained, you can choose to sap their life force. The creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage per two levels, and you regain half of the damage dealt. The effect then ends. If you take damage before then, the effect ends early.</li>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, you can wrap dark energy around a creature to curse it. Choose a creature within 20 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC, with disadvantage if you are within 10 feet, or be cursed. A cursed creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. In addition, if the creature loses half or more of its hit points while cursed, it gains 1 level of exhaustion. After that, for every 30 hit points it loses, it gains another level, up to 5.</p>
			<p class="indent">A cursed creature can make the saving throw again at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on a success. In addition, the curse can be ended by taking a long rest, or by the spell <i>lesser restoration</i> or similar magic. When the curse ends, all exhaustion levels gained by it disappear. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining all spent uses after a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you reach 12th level in this class, the damage increases to 4d6 and the curse ends only from the save or the <i>greater restoration</i> spell or similar magic.</p>
