			<p>Pentadrones are shaped like a five-pointed clockwork starfish with one eye on each appendage, on top of five strong mechanical legs, and a tube protruding from the center of the star. They are capable of performing five simultaneous tasks at a time.</p>
			<p class="indent">Like all modrons, pentadrones had an absolute sense of hierarchy and order, and could not be persuaded to disobey their instructions or betray their purpose in any way.</p>
