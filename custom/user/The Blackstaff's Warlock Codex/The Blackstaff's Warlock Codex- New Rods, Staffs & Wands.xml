		<description>
		<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to speak its command word and expend 1 charge. When you do so, you choose a 50-foot square of land within 100 feet. Any natural plants in that area die. Any magical plants or plant creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15), taking 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
		<p class="indent">When you expend a charge, instead of choosing an area, you can instead target one nonplant creature within 100 feet, commanding the wand to drain and dessicate it. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). On a failure, it takes 2d8 necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded.</p>			<p class="indent">The wand regains 1d6+1 charges at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into salt and is destroyed.</p>

		<description>
		<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it you can use an action to speak its command word and expend 1 charge. When you do so, the wand fires a “tooth” of pure magical force at a target of your choice within 100 feet of you. You make a ranged spell attack against the target, using your choice of Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability and including your proficiency bonus.</p>
		<p class="indent">Armored targets are easier to strike with this attack. If the target is wearing armor or wielding a shield, roll a d4, and reduce the target’s Armor Class against this attack by the result. If the target is both wearing armor and wielding a shield, you roll a d8 instead of a d4. If the target is wearing medium armor, you increase the penalty by 2; if it is wearing heavy armor, you instead increase the penalty by 5.</p>
		<p class="indent">On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack. In addition, if a target takes 5 or more damage from this attack, one shield it is using or suit of armor it is wearing (your choice) takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.</p>
		<p class="indent">The wand regains 1d6+1 charges at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge roll a d20. On a 1, the wands crumbles into a pile of human teeth and is destroyed.</p>
