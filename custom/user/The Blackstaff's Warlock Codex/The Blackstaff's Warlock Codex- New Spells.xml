<p>With a flash of light, you bring instant vengeance to the attacking enemy. As part of the reaction used to cast this spell, you choose to do either one or both of the following:</p>
			<ul>
	<li>Teleport to an unoccupied space, as long as that space is not farther away than you are now from the creature that made the triggering attack.</li>
  <li>Make one melee weapon attack against the attacker if it is within reach. You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of this attack if you choose. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage.</li>
			</ul>   
<p>If you are unable to do either one, the spell ends. Otherwise, after the triggering attack is resolved, you mark the creature who made that attack until the end of your next turn. While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you. This spell ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.</p>
      <p>
<span class="feature">At Higher Levels.</span>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases to 60 feet, and the extra radiant damage inflicted with the melee weapon attack increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

    <description>
<p>Your magic ensnares an attacking enemy, movingit so its attack targets you instead of your ally. The creature that made the triggering attack roll must roll a Charisma saving throw, which happens before the attack’s damage is resolved. On a failed save, you teleport it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. It then makes the triggering attack against you instead, comparing the same attack roll to your Armor Class to determine whether it hits or misses you.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, after the triggering attack is resolved, the attacking creature takes 1d4 psychic damage and you mark it until the end of your next turn. While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you. This spell ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.</p>
      <p>
<span class="feature">At Higher Levels.</span>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases to 60 feet, and the psychic damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

      <p>You infuse a weapon you touch with the energies of one of the Outer Planes, energies which correspond strongly to certain ethical or moral alignments and inflict extra damage against certain types of creatures. When you cast this spell, choose one of these four planes:</p>
			<ul>
	<li><b>Elysium (Good):</b> Aberrations, chromatic dragons, elementals, fiends, or undead.</li>
	<li><b>Hades (Evil):</b> Beasts, celestials, metallic dragons, humanoids, or plants.</li>
	<li><b>Limbo (Chaos):</b> Constructs, angels, dragons, devils, or giants.</li>
	<li><b>Mechanus (Law):</b> Aberrations, demons, fey, monstrosities, oozes, or undead.</li>
			</ul>         
<p>Until the spell ends, the weapon inflicts an additional 2d6 force damage against the types of creatures listed for the chosen plane. Your alignment may limit your choice of planar energies when you cast this spell. If you are evilaligned, you cannot choose Elysium; if you are good-aligned, you cannot choose Hades, if you are lawful in alignment, you cannot choose Limbo; if your alignment is chaotic, you cannot choose Mechanus.</p>

<p>You alter the flow of time around you, granting yourself and your allies a crucial moment to reposition yourselves. As part of the bonus action used to cast this spell, you can immediately take the Dash action. If you move at least 10 feet, any ally within 5 feet of you when you end your movement can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed. Movement granted by this spell does not provoke opportunity attacks.

<p>A flash of silver light streaks toward a creature of your choice you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target suffers 1d6 radiant damage, and you outline your enemy with the silver glow of the Astral Plane, exuding an energizing light that may aid an ally. The next time an ally hits the target with an attack roll before the end of your next turn, that ally gains temporary hit points equal to half the radiant damage this spell Page 57 inflicted. Creatures with 0 hit points and inanimate objects do not grant temporary hit points from this spell when they are struck.</p>
      <p>
<span class="feature">At Higher Levels.</span>This spell's radiant damage increases when you reach higher levels, becoming 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

<p>You assume a supernatural combat stance that channels terror through your weapon in the form of a howling wind. Until the spell ends, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, it takes an additional 3d4 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, and you can push the target up to 5 feet away from you.</p>

<p>As you wield your weapon in a sweeping strike, it whispers menacingly, filling your foes' minds with despair. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Make a melee spell attack against each target.

    <supports>Warlock, Wizard, Artificer</supports>
    <description>
<p>You temporarily become a creature of shadow, flickering in and out of a demiplane on the borders of the Shadowfell as your weapon ripples with dark magic. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to necrotic damage, you inflict 3d4 additional necrotic damage whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack.</p>
<p class="indent">For the duration, you roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in a shadowy reflection of it, which lies somewhere on the planar boundary between your current location and the Shadowfell. (If you are already in the Shadowfell when you cast this spell, the spell fails and the casting is wasted.) At the start of you next turn, and when the spell ends if you are in the shadowy reflection, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.</p>
<p class="indent">While in the shadowy reflection, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything is lightly obscured, and you can't see anything more than 30 feet away. You are not truly in the Shadowfell nor in your previous location during that time, but somewhere in between the planes. Whenever you are in the shadowy reflection, only other creatures with resistance or immunity to necrotic damage can
see you or affect you, or be affected by you.</p>

<p>The next time you hit a creature with a we apon attack before this spell ends, your weapon is weathed in dark energy that freezes your foe in terror. The attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage, and if the target is not immune to the frightened condition, its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.

<p>A shower of radiance falls upon your enemies and then bursts out, creating a cage of burning embers that are painful to pass through. Choose a 10-foot cube within range. Each creature in the cube must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d4 radiant damage if it fails.

<p>You gamble some of your own life force on a curse that bedevils your enemy but may empower you. You can not cast this spell if you currently have less than 5 hit points.

<p>Both your hands must be empty when you cast this spell, which causes an otherworldly polearm made of smoldering green iron to appear in your two free hands. This magic polearm lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a martial melee weapon with which you are proficient, and you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon. It deals 4d10 necrotic damage on hit and has the heavy, reach, and two-handed properties.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, when you hit a creature with the polearm, the target’s speed is reduced by half, you pull it 5 feet closer to you, and all melee attacks against the target are made with advantage until it starts its turn further than 5 feet away from you.</p>
<p class="indent">If you drop the weapon, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the polearm to reappear in your hand.</p>

<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and magically conjured acid traces the path your weapon cut through the air.</p>
<p class="indent">If the target ends its next turn within 5 feet of one or more other creatures you can see, you can inflict acid damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier on your choice of one of those creatures.

<span class="feature">At Higher Levels.</span>This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d10 acid damage to the target, and the acid damage to the second creature increases to 1d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d10 at 11th level and 17th level.

<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails.

<p class="indent">The next time a creature marked by you with this spell makes an attack roll that doesn’t target you while it is within 5 feet of you, it has disadvantage on the attack.</p>
<p class="indent">If a creature marked by you with this spell willingly moves more than 30 feet away from you, or if makes an attack that suffers disadvantage from this spell, it immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the spell ends.</p>

A 15-foot cube that includes the space occupied by the target of your attack becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.</p>

Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor have disadvantage on this save. On a failure, until the end of the creature's next turn its speed is reduced by 10 feet and it cannot take reactions or bonus actions. On a success, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, but it suffers no other effects.</p>

necrotic damage equal to your level, which cannot be reduced or prevented by any means, and then you reroll the triggering attack. You must use the second roll.</p>

<p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against a creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a miss, the spell ends. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and the air shimmers around you as an illusory duplicate of you appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of the target. If no such space exists, the spell fails.</p>
<p class="indent">Until the spell ends, the duplicate persists, appearing to be a living, breathing, active version of you. If the target ends its turn more than 60 feet away from the duplicate, or if you end your turn more than 60 feet away from the duplicate, the spell ends. The duplicate mimics your actions to a degree, but no matter where you are, it seeks to remain close to the target.</p>
<p class="indent">If the target ends its turn more than 5 feet away from the duplicate, the duplicate moves up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. If no such space exists, the duplicate moves to the unoccupied space closest to the target.</p>
<p class="indent">While the duplicate is within 5 feet of the target, you can make melee attacks against the target as if it were within 5 feet of you, just as if you were attacking from the space the duplicate is occupying. If you hit the target with a melee attack roll while it is within 5 feet of the duplicate, the attack inflicts additional psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
<p class="indent">While you are within 5 feet of your duplicate, whenever an attack roll is made against you, you can use your reaction to roll a d20. If you roll an 11 or higher on the die, the attack targets the duplicate instead of you.</p>
<p class="indent">The duplicate’s AC equals your spellcasting DC. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. If the duplicate is destroyed, the spell ends.</p>

<p>You transform any large quantity of water within a 10-foot cube centered on a point you choose into a deadly poison. This spell only affects
bodies of water of at least 10 gallons or more within the affected area, not separate smaller quantities of water. It can also be liquid that is
mostly water (such as blood, sewage, or wine), but a living creature’s vital fluids cannot be affected. Any creature with its head or one of its
breathing passages (such as a humanoid’s nose or mouth) currently submerged into water you have transformed with this spell must make a make a
Constitution saving throw at the beginning of any turn in which they are so submerged.</p>
<p class="indent">On a failure, the creature is poisoned for the duration, and they take 4d8 poison damage. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. On a success, the creature can choose to spit the water out and take no damage, or continue to swallow it and take half damage. If the creature failed its save, at the start of each of the creature's turns before the spell ends, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 poison damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.</p>
<p class="indent">Creatures who do not need to save against the spell but who are within 5 feet of the transformed water can use an action to apply poison to one weapon, piece of ammunition, or portion of food or drink. Once applied, the poison retains potency for the duration of the spell or until someone must save against it. If a creature is struck with the poisoned weapon or ammunition, or if it ingests the poisoned food or drink, it must make a Constitution save or be poisoned for the duration and take 1d8 poison damage, or 2d8 if the poison is ingested. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. Creatures that succeed on their save take half damage, but suffer no other effects.</p>

<span class="feature">At Higher Levels.</span>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature who is drinking at the same time, and the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

its life it feels guiltiest about. You choose one humanoid creature within range and force it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, until

Wisdom and Charisma ability checks.</p>

		<description>
		<p>The <i>guilt lash</i> spell does not appear on any class's spell list. The only way known to learn it (besides finding it in a spellbook somewhere) is by visiting the Domain of Dread known as Sithicus, a neighbor of Barovia. Since a cataclysmic event there known as the Hours of Screaming Shadows, the deathknight Lord Soth who once ruled that domain has not been seen, and a miasma of overpowering guilt lingers over the land. One side-effect of this guild is that any spellcasting creature that finishes a long rest in Sithicus will, from that point, treat the <i>guild lash</i> spell as if it were on all of the spell lists from which it can learn spells. They can learn the spell whenever they would normally be able to learn a 5th-level spell, even after the leave that domain. Wizards of 9th level or higher who have finished a long rest in Sithicus can scribe <i>guilt lash</i> in their spellbooks at any time after that, for the usual cost in gold and time.</p>

<p>This spell allows you to draw iron or steel objects to yourself by projecting a magnetic ray. Choose one object within range that is nonmagical and made of ferrous metal. This object must weigh less than 40 lbs. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, it immediately flies into your space, where you can either catch it with your hand (requiring no action) or let it fall at your feet.</p>
<p class="indent">Using an action each round, you can target one object you can see within range of the spell with this effect.</p>
<p class="indent">If an object you target with this spell is being held or carried by a creature, that creature must roll a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops the object, and it flies to your space, where you either catch it with your hand or let it fall at your feet. If the object is being worn by a creature (like a helm or a chain shirt), the creature makes the same Strength saving
throw but has advantage on the roll. On a failure, the creature is pulled up to 60 feet towards you if it is Medium-size or smaller.</p>
<p class="indent">If the item is secured in some way (such as being chained to a wall or tied down with a rope), but not being held or worn, you make an ability check to break the restraint, as if you were making a Strength check to break or burst whatever is securing it with your own hands. Instead of making a Strength check, you make a check with your spellcasting ability score (adding your proficiency bonus). If the check succeeds, you free the item and it flies to your space as described above.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also attempt to move a metal creature that weighs less than your limit for this spell (such as a Tiny construct). The creature makes a Strength saving throw with advantage against this effect. If the save fails, you can move the creature toward you just as you would any other metal object.</p>
<p class="indent">Until this spell ends, your ability to carry, lift, push, or drag any objects you have moved to your space with this spell is calculated as if you had a Strength score of 20 (giving you a carrying capacity of 300 pounds and allowing you to push, lift, or drag up to 600 pounds, if you are Small or Medium sized), unless your Strength if higher.</p>
<p class="indent">If you move during the spell’s duration, you can choose any object that you moved to your space with this spell which you are not carrying, lifting, pushing, dragging, or wearing to either move with you as you go (levitating just above the level of your feet) or remain in the square you moved it to.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you move an object to your space with this spell, you have advantage on saving throws and opposed rolls against dropping it, and creatures seeking to move the item from your space have disadvantage on rolls to do so. When the spell ends, if you are holding, wearing, or carrying an object that is too heavy for you, it falls softly to the ground, landing harmlessly at your feet.</p>
   <p>
<span class="feature">At Higher Levels.</span>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the weight limit of objects you can move with this spell increases by 10 pounds for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
5th or 6th level, you can choose up to two objects within range each time you use your action for this spell, instead of just one. If the spell slot is 7th level or higher, you can choose up to three objects instead.

    <description>
<p>The ice seems to freeze in your lungs as an emerald green star appears in the sky, and tendrils the same color reach down from inside
that frozen star and lift your opponents into the air, squeezing the life out of them. Choose a number of targets within range that and within 30 feet of each other equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. They take 2d10 cold damage and 2d10 bludgeoning damage and are restrained 10 feet in the air on a failed save. They take half damage and are not restrained on a successful saving throw. Targets restrained by the tendrils take 2d10 cold damage and 2d10 bludgeoning damage at the start of their turns. A restrained target may make a Strength check against your spell save DC to escape the tendrils.</p>

<p>You emit a powerful battle cry that hammers your enemy, distracting it from a nearby ally. Choose a creature within range that is adjacent to one of your allies. That target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails the saving throw, it takes 1d6 thunder damage and you can choose one ally that is within 5 feet of the target. That ally can use its reaction to move up to 10 feet without provoking an opportunity attack from the target. The sound of the battle cry can be heard up to 100 feet away.</p>

<span class="feature">At Higher Levels.</span>This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels, dealing 2d6 thunder damage at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

<p>With an aggressive strike, you threaten punishment of any creature that dares enter the space you claim as yours. Until this spell ends,
whenever you hit one or more creatures with a ranged attack, you can psychically claim an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of
one target that attack.</p>
<p class="indent">If any creature willing enters the claimed space, you can immediately use your reaction to either make a ranged weapon attack against that creature or to cast a cantrip targeting only that creature that requires a ranged spell attack. If you cast a cantrip as a reaction with this spell, it must normally have a casting time of 1 action, which you change to 1 reaction for this casting.</p>
<p class="indent">If you hit the creature with a ranged weapon attack or cantrip made as a reaction with this spell, it deals an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the creature.</p>
<p class="indent">A space you claim with your <i>warning shot</i> remains claimed until the spell ends. A space stops being claimed early if it is occupied at the end of any creature’s turn or if you use this spell to claim a different space.</p>
   <p>
<span class="feature">At Higher Levels.</span>If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage inflicted by your special reaction from this spell increases by 1d8 for every two levels above 1st.</p>
   <p>
<p class="indent">If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can have up to two spaces claimed at once. When you claim a third space, the space you’ve had claimed longest stops being claimed.</p>

<p>You can speak 5 words which are magically amplified so that every creature within a half a mile can hear them. Deaf creatures cannot hear the words. Sleeping creatures are automatically awakened by the words. These words cannot be used to perform an attack based on sound (a banshee’s wail, for example). Although the words become incredibly loud, they do not damage nearby creatures.</p>
