		<description>
		<p>The consciousness that holds your pact is an entity (or group of entities) devoted to perfect absolutes of order, logic, or law that no being of flesh could ever attain. Such beings often manifest as masters of clockwork hierarchies, creators of wondrous devices, or even as transcendent machines themselves. Your pact grants innate understanding of the machinery that drives the multiverse, and intertwines your destiny with an otherworldly plane of law, such as Daanvi the Perfect Order or the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus.</p>
		<p class="indent">Your patron pursues its aims according to rigid and unyielding principles, but its agenda is often indecipherable. You may not share your patron’s goals or even its alignment, but it grants you power because it believes you will serve a larger purpose. Beings of this sort include Primus, lord and creator of the modrons on the lawful plane of Mechanus; Zaerith Menyar Ag-Gith, the immortal, self-proclaimed god-king of the githzerai; celestials more devoted to order than moral good, such as the Arcadian Avengers; the most powerful of the extraplanar magical constructs known as the inevitables; and the legendary Wind Dukes of Aaqa, who created the famed Rod of Seven Parts.</p>

		<p>At 1st level, your patron grants you insight into others’ thoughts you can use to predict their actions. While you’re not in combat or concentrating on a spell, you can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet of you, provided that creature shares a language with you. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.</p>
		<p class="indent">In addition, if an attack hits you while you are concentrating on a spell, as a reaction you can force the attacker to reroll the attack, using the lower of the two rolls. Until the end of your next turn, all attack rolls that creature makes against you have disadvantage. Once you force the reroll of an attack roll with this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

Also, whenever the target of a concentration spell you are maintaining (such as the <i>hex</i> spell) is an aberration, celestial, construct, elemental, fey, or fiend, you can deal extra damage to that creature once per turn when you hit with an attack roll. The extra damage is psychic damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>

		<description>
		<p>At 6th level, a unique construct is sent by your patron to serve you. You learn the <i>find familiar</i> spell as a warlock spell, if you don’t already know it. But when you cast it you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or summon it as a pentadrone, a five-armed construct that is one of the most advanced forms of modron (as described in the Monster Manual). A pentadrone you summon as your familiar in this way has the following modifications:</p>
	  	<ul>			
		<li>It can magically disguise itself as a Large beast of your choice with a Challenge rating of 2 or lower (such as warhorse), physically rearranging its form to appear to be the new creature, but not gaining any of its traits or abilities.</li>
		<li>It does not have the truesight sense, or the Multiattack or Paralysis Gas actions, but it has darkvision with a range of 120 feet that is not impeded by magical darkness. When you reach 11th level as a warlock, this becomes truesight with a range of 120 feet.</li>
		<li>If you are the target of a melee attack and your modron familiar is within 5 feet of the attacker, you can use your reaction to command the servant to respond, using its reaction to make one Arm attack against the attacker.</li>
		<li>The pentadrone adds a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus to its AC, saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls, and its Arm attacks inflict force damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</li>	</ul>
		<p>If you have the Pact of the Chain feature, you gain an additional advantage when you choose to summon a pentadone as your familiar; whenever you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action during your turn, your modron familiar can use its reaction to make one Arm attack.</p>
		<p class="indent">Once you reach 11th level as a warlock, when your modron familiar uses its reaction to make an Arm attack, it can make two Arm attacks instead.</p>

		<supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
		<description>
		<p>In recent years, certain would-be mages dream of walking the precincts of an ancient city, its streets shrouded in darkness—and that those streets whisper secrets. In Eberron, many claim it is Metrol or one of the other lost cities of Cyre, blighted from the world on the Day of Mourning. In Faerûn, most claim it is the City of Shade, also known as Thultanthar, a Netherese flying city that returned from millennia in the Shadowfell before crashing upon Myth Drannor. Others speak of different lost cities, or of Shadowfell settlements such as Gloomwrought, Evernight (the umbral twin of Neverwinter) or Ikemmu, a legendary metropolis said to exist in both the Underdark and the Shadowfell at the same time. Whether it is one of these cities, or if more than one has become such patron, it has a conscious will of its own—and that will wishes to bargain.</p>
		<p class="indent">This patron’s warlocks not only gain insight into darkness, but into the secret life of cities everywhere. They hear the whispers of elemental spirits in chimney-smoke and cobblestones, foresee the ebb and flow of urban commerce like a sailor knows the changing of the tides, and feel the hope and despair of multitudes rise like heat from avenues beneath their feet.</p>
		<p class="indent">In the Realms, the phenomenon of cities infused with Shadowfell magic making pacts with warlocks has prompted some sages to wonder if other enchanted cities—such as Silverymoon or Evereska, both sites of mythals, or even Waterdeep, which sprawls atop the spell-haunted expanse of Undermountain—could also have awakened, and whether they have warlocks of their own active in Faerûn.</p>

		<p class="indent">In Eberron, those beings of Khyber most connected to poisonous creatures or to cultures of endless feuding and betrayal are such patrons, including the Overlord Sakinnirot the Scar that Abides, or certain daelkyr such as the Kyrzin the Prince of Slime, the Master of Silence, and Valaara, the Crawling Queen. Other examples of the Dark patrons in Eberron include the entity the Umbragen drow call the Umbra and certain shadowy beings serving the two different aspects of the drow god Vulkoor worshipped by the tribal Hantarkul and the scorrow, respectively.</p>

		<description>
		<p>Also At 1st level, if a creature places its trust in you, your magic grants it special benefits. When you finish a short or long rest, you can choose one willing creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to become your <i>trusting ally</i>. While a creature that is your trusting ally can see you, if you are conscious and within 10 feet of that ally, it gains a special benefit: once per turn when that ally makes an ability check or saving throw that does not include its proficiency bonus, it can roll a d4 and add the result to the ability check or saving throw. The trusting ally can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use this benefit, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.</p>
		<p class="indent">You can have a number of trusting allies equal to your Charisma modifier. Once a creature is your trusting ally, it remains so until you go more than 24 hours without seeing each other or until either one of you uses an action to end this effect.</p>
		<p class="indent">The die a trusting ally rolls for this feature changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 10th level, and a d10 at 15th level.</p>	<p>However, a trusting ally becomes less resilient against your magic. When your trusting ally rolls a saving throw against a spell you cast, that ally has disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>

You can cast <i>dominate monster</i> on the target as a warlock spell without using a spell slot. While charmed by this spell, the target considers any creature hostile to you to be a threat to itself, and any creature friendly to you as a friend, so if the creature completes an order from you and doesn’t receive further direction, it continues attacking creatures hostile to you as best it can.</p>

		<description>
		<p>In ancient times, the undersea progenitors of the half-human hybrids known as the Deep Ones passed both lineage and lore to the mortals with whom they had dealings. They taught of ancient, god-like beings, perhaps their ancestors, who lay dead yet dreaming beneath the sea. Those so chosen, or so cursed, shared in these dreams. Sages today disagree on the nature of these legends: is there only one being called the Drowned One, or two, or many? Does the name refer to a powerful aberration like a kraken or aboleth, a primordial god, or something older, perhaps an alien presence from the Far Realm?</p>
		<p class="indent">Having either experienced such visions yourself or learned the rites by oral tradition, you are marked by the power of the Drowned One. Whether by accident or as part of a rite, you drowned and nearly died. While unconscious, you made your pact. Since then, you are most comfortable close to the ocean and have an affinity for things in their primal, unrefined forms. Most who make such a pact find that afterwards they prefer iron over steel, foraged food over fine cuisine, and instinctive cunning over civilized ways.</p>
		<p class="indent">Eschewing the finery some spellcasters enjoy, warlocks of the Drowned One are of a humble appearance, marked by mottled sealskin clothes, wild hair braided with seaweed, and driftwood cudgels. They favor colors of the sea, and are said to be touched by both madness and prophecy.</p>

Rumors speak of a great war near the end of time itself, with many sides vying for control of the outcome. These beings hold secrets about the destinies of individuals, called “the Fated Ones,” who play important roles in shaping future events. For many Foretold patrons, it seems their strategy is to help guide the destinies of the Fated Ones by bestowing them with  nowledge, visions, and magic to aid them in achieving important milestones that profoundly influence the future.</p>
		<p class="indent">As a Fated One, you have abstract visions that help guide you toward your destiny. Though you haven’t seen or heard directly from your patron, you know there is incredible power behind the source of your visions—they help to establish a conduit providing you with insights and magical powers. You must fulfill your destiny by interpreting your visions and using your granted powers to the best of your abilities.</p>

		<supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
		<description>
		<p>You have made a pact with a legendary demigod-like being that rules over a certain type or group of animals. Such entities hold their own realms or territories on the wild and beautiful Outer Plane known as the Beastlands. Most are known as Animal Lords, and they are indifferent to nearly everything, except those creatures and events which affect the beasts they consider their subjects.</p>
		<p class="indent">Your patron is bestial and instinctive, yet more intelligent than all but the most brilliant mortals. As cunning as fiends and as unpredictable as the Archfey, it takes on both humanoid and beast forms at will. Such beings are not ignorant of civilization, though they take little interest unless their subjects often dwell in civilized lands.</p>
		<p class="indent">The most famous of the Animal Lords is the Cat Lord, worshipped by the tabaxi, who rules over cats of all species and sizes, from housecats to sabretooth tigers to tressym. A related but lesser being, the King of Cats, seems to have dominion over only domesticated breeds, and is a housecat elevated to that position upon the previous king’s death. Legends of an imprisoned Tiger King are yet to be confirmed.</p>
		<p class="indent">More obscure tales of the Beastlands name other semi-mythical Animal Lords such as the Sage of Bears, the Lady of Foxes, the Lord of the Apes, the Rat King, the sorcerous Raven King (whose relationship to the Raven Queen is not precisely understood), the Horse Princes, the Baroness of Sharks, Ghondaur the Wolf-King, the Great Ram Brothers, and the elusive Mulwë, Prince of Hares. However, it is likely many more of these beings exist, with each holding dominion over a different part of the animal kingdom.</p>

		<supports>Otherworldly Patron</supports>
		<description>
		<p>The immortal entity you made your pact with does not watch you from some distant realm, but physically dwells with and rules over the people of your homeland. If you hail from the Domains of Dread, your patron is likely a darklord; it could be an undead ruler like Strahd von Zarovich of Barovia or Lord Soth of Sithicus, or an undying sorcerer-king draining arcane energies from the dwindling life of the city-state around him, like Kalid-ma of Kalidnay. In Eberron, your patron could be one of the Inspired governors who rule the provinces of Riedra and channel greater power might from the Plane of Dreams. In a Forgotten Realms campaign, you might draw arcane might from a pact with Gilgeam the God-King of Unther, or the all-powerful lich Szass Tam, ruler of Thay.</p>
		<p class="indent">No rebellion against your patron has ever succeeded, for its worldly power is matched by supernatural might. You know your patron has even greater ambitions—perhaps seeking to ascend to deity or some greater state of arcane power, or to escape a curse binding them to the land—and one way or another, your pact furthers those ambitions. You may willingly act as your pact-holder’s agent or templar, helping keep the peace among their subjects and enforce laws, or you might have fled your homeland for a freer life elsewhere. Perhaps you are even secretly connected to a clandestine resistance.</p>

		<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn.

		<p>Starting at 14th level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can empower it by draining life energy from a nearby creature. When you gain this feature, choose two of the Metamagic options from a sorcerer’s Metamagic feature. Whenever you gain a warlock level, you can select one of these Metamagic options and replace it with a new one of your choice. You can use these Metamagic options, but you do not fuel them with sorcery points.</p>
		<p class="indent">Instead, whenever you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to attempt to apply one of your two chosen Metamagic features to that by forcing a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead automatically succeed, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. On a success, nothing happens. On a failure, the target takes 6d8 necrotic damage, you apply the chosen Metamagic option to the spell as if you spent any required sorcery points, and all nonmagical plants that are within 30 feet of both you and the target that are not  creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.</p>

		<description>
		<p>Hags come in many varieties. Most are fey or fiends, but some covens transcend the normal types, unifying to become otherworldly powers unto themselves. Often connected to goddesses of dark sorcery, these covens exist outside of time itself, appearing when they wish to interfere in mortal events with threats and prophecies.</p>
		<p class="indent">No one seeks a pact with these all-seeing hags—their dealings occur only in times and places of their own choosing, at moments in time when great destinies intertwine or unravel. Just as covens combine fey and fiendish entities into one circle of horror, the Pact of the Wyrd Coven combines abilities from the Pacts of the Archfey and the Fiend with the near-omniscient prescience of these greater hags.</p>
		<p class="indent">Most of Eberron’s Wyrd Coven warlocks make their pacts with Droaam’s Daughters of Sora Kell.</p>

        <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to boil eldritch ingredients in a special cauldron-like vessel provided by your patron, creating a wyrd concoction. You also gain proficiency with alchemists’ supplies, and if you have them on your person you can use them to create this wyrd concoction in your vessel. If you do not have your vessel, you can conjure a new one with a 10- minute ritual. Creating the concoction takes one hour, which can be part of a short or long rest. It remains sealed in your vessel until you expend it or finish a short or long rest, in which case it vaporizes at once. It has the following uses:</p>

        <li>When an attack against the current target of a concentration spell you cast scores a critical hit, you can expend your wyrd concoction as a reaction to force creatures within 5 feet of the slain creature to roll a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spellcasting DC or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</li>
