			<p><em>In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret,</em></p>
			<p><em>For none could tame our savage souls yet you the challenge met,</em></p>
			<p><em>Under palest watch, you taught, we changed, base instincts were redeemed,</em></p>
            <p><em>A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed.</em></p>
			<p class="indent">– From 'Elegy for Hallownest' by Monomon the Teacher</p>
			<h4>A PURE VESSEL</h4>
			<p>Born of wyrm and root, of soul and void, you are a pale knight. You rescue the world's vulnerable populations from terrible fiends and evil deities.</p>
			<p class="indent">Traditionally, pale knights do not speak and show no emotion. However, in the context of roleplaying games, feel free to break this precedent.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A PALE KNIGHT</h4>
			<p>As you build your Pale Knight, think about the origin of their abilities. Were they born with combat capability, or was it gained through years of difficult training?</p>
			<p class="indent">It's also important to consider what combination of charms you will be using. They are similar to Eldritch Invocations but can be equipped and unequipped each short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is generally best to have both a high Dexterity and a high Wisdom score, but you can lean more into one or the other via your choice of charms and ASI/feats.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, bear in mind that your main class resource, Soul, is not recovered by resting, but rather by striking enemies. You will have to engage in melee combat in order to use your powerful ranged attacks.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a Pale Knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, your highest ability score should be Dexterity, followed by Wisdom and then Constitution. Second, choose the Outlander background.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As a Pale Knight, you gain the following class features.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Your pale heritage allows you to harness the mystic power of Soul, the energy filling the universe with life. Your ability to gather and make use of this energy is represented by a number of Soul points. Your pale knight level determines the maximum number of Soul points you can have, as shown in the Pale Knight table.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can spend these points to fuel various Soul features. You start knowing one such feature: Focus. You learn more Soul features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
            <h5>GAINING SOUL</h5>
            <p>You gain Soul by successfully striking a hostile creature with your Nail. (Whether a creature is "hostile" is determined by your DM.) Doing so restores 1 Soul point. Additionally, all of your Soul points are restored whenever your character level increases.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Optional: Ancient Wonders.</em></strong> Your DM may allow you to find statues, magical springs, or other ancient wonders throughout the world that can replenish your Soul points.</p>
			<h5>SOUL ATTACKS</h5>
			<p>As you gain levels in this class, you will learn Soul-fueled attacks. Wisdom is your Soul attack ability, since your Soul power derives from your attunement to its energy. You use your Wisdom modifier whenever a feature refers to your Soul modifier. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Charm or Soul feature you use and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Soul save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Soul attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h6>FOCUS</h6>
			<p>You have the ability to use the Soul you collect to restore your own vitality. You can choose to do so at the start of your turn by spending 3 Soul points if you aren't incapacitated. Until the start of your next turn, you are incapacitated and your speed is 0.</p>
			<p class="indent">If by the start of your next turn you have not taken damage, you regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your Pale Knight level. If you do take damage, 2 of the 3 Soul points you used are restored and you are no longer incapacitated, but you do not recover hit points.</p>

			<p>You can equip "unbreakable" charms before reaching their level requirement. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while one of these charms is equipped, it becomes "broken", and you cannot equip it again until you meet its level requirement.</p>

			<p>Beginning at 6th level, you gain the ability to conjure an astral Nail, which you can use to cut through the veil between dreams and waking. As an action, you can make a melee Soul attack against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes no damage, but you learn the surface thoughts of the creature as if you had cast detect thoughts. The target can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against your Soul save DC to become aware of your intrusion into its mind.</p>

    <description>
      <h4>ARTHROPOD VESSEL TRAITS</h4>
      <p>Your Arthropod Vessel character has a number of traits in common with all other Arthropod Vessels.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Increase one ability score by 2, and a different score by 1.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Age.</span>Little is known about how arthropod vessels age. They are assumed to have lifespans similar to a human's.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>These vessels were created for a very specific purpose. In general, they adhere to lawful alignments.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Size.</span>Arthropod vessels find themselves to be shorter than most creatures they meet. Your size is Small.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Natural Armor.</span>You are equipped with a protective exoskeleton. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Arthropod Leaps.</span>Whenever you make a long or high jump, you can roll a d8 and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as normal.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Hollow Body</span>You don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests. You are immune to disease.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Born of Void.</span>Whenever you are reduced to zero hit points, you summon a shadowy doppelganger known as a Shade, as if you had cast simulacrum. The Shade is permanently under the effects of the slow spell and can fly (hover) at its reduced walking speed, and it has illusory copies of all your equipment. It acts immediately after each of your turns, attacking whichever creature within 30 feet of your body is closest to your body (choosing randomly at a tie, and choosing you if you are conscious), and it will continue to exist until it drops to zero hit points, even if you die. The Shade will not attack constructs or creatures that do not age. While it is summoned, you gain a level of exhaustion that lasts until it is defeated. If you drop to zero hit points again before it's defeated, the Shade's hit points are fully restored.<br/>
        <span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read, and write Common, Undercommon, and Abyssal.<br/>

The Shade is permanently under the effects of the slow spell and can fly (hover) at its reduced walking speed, and it has illusory copies of all your equipment. It acts immediately after each of your turns, attacking whichever creature within 30 feet of your body is closest to your body (choosing randomly at a tie, and choosing you if you are conscious), and it will continue to exist until it drops to zero hit points, even if you die. The Shade will not attack constructs or creatures that do not age. While it is summoned, you gain a level of exhaustion that lasts until it is defeated. If you drop to zero hit points again before it's defeated, the Shade's hit points are fully restored.</p>

			<p>As an action, you can choose to make a special melee attack. These are known as Nail Arts. You have 3 options when performing Nail Arts:</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Cyclone Slash</i>. You make an attack against every creature in your Nail's reach. Each attack that hits deals extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Dash Slash</i>. You must use the movement provided by your Mothwing Cloak immediately before making this attack. If it hits, the attack deals extra damage equal to four times your proficiency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent"><i>Great Slash</i>. You make an attack against a creature in your Nail's reach. The attack roll has advantage, deals extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus, and scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 18 or higher. This attack counts as two strikes for the purpose of recovering Soul points.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you perform Nail Arts, you cannot hit a second target using <i>Mark of Pride</i>, and you cannot make the ranged attack provided by <i>Grubberfly's Elegy</i>. (Nail Arts do not use the Attack action, so they cannot benefit from features such as Extra Attack.)</p>
